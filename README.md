## What's the difference
* Speed
* Simple
* Works on all operating systems

## How to use
#### Windows
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/flew-software/filecrypt/releases/latest)
2. Create a folder named "filecrypt" in any drive
3. Move the downloaded executable(.exe) to the folder created in step 2
4. Add the path of the created folder created in step 2 into [windows path variable](https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html) 
5. Open the command prompt and enter `filecrypt --help` for detailed info about using flags 

#### flags
* `--force` - Force write even if a file exists with that name (overwrite) DESTRUCTIVE
* `--location` - The location of the file to encrypt/decrypt(determined by the mode flag)
* `--mode` - FileCrypt mode (encrypt/decrypt These can be replaced with their first letters) Example: `filecrypt --mode=e --location="super secret file.txt" --password="test"`
* `--password` - (removed in release v2 & later) Password to be used while encrypting/decrypting   
**Note: due to security issues with commandline flags the password will be prompted at runtime.**

### What is a .fcef file
fcef (File. Crypt. Encrypted. File) is an encrypted file that is generated by FileCrypt,
If you know the password that it was encrypted with it can be decrypted with FileCrypt using the `--mode=d`or `--mode=decrypt` flag.

### How is FileCrypt so small
Because Filecrypt
* Only uses the standard library
* Has no unwanted code
* Is built with `-ldflags "-s -w"` flag
* Executable is compressed with [upx](https://upx.github.io/) (Only extra small binaries)

## Docs
* [FCEF format](./docs/fcef_format.md)
